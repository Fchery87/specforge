# SpecForge: Spec-Driven Project Generator

SpecForge is a high-performance scaffold designed for building **repo-native**, **spec-driven**, and **LLM-agnostic** applications. It provides a solid foundation for generating, previewing, and exporting complex project architectures.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **Database & Backend**: [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)
- **Authentication**: [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Brutalist + Dark Mode)
- **Components**: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) + [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Utilities**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/), [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Phase-Based Workflow**: Structured project generation across multiple phases.
- **Anti-Truncation Foundation**: Chunked generation helpers to handle large LLM outputs.
- **Artifact Management**: Real-time preview and individual download of generated artifacts.
- **Project Export**: Full project ZIP export functionality.
- **Enterprise Ready**: Designed to scale from startup prototypes to enterprise systems.

## 🛠️ Quickstart

### 1. Installation

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure your credentials:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` & `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`

### 3. Development

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

In a separate terminal, start the Convex development environment:

```bash
bunx convex dev
```

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app/`: Next.js application routes and layouts.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components.
- `convex/`: Backend schema, mutations, and actions.
- `lib/`: Shared utilities (LLM registry, ZIP helpers, etc.).
- `docs/`: Technical documentation and architecture overviews.

## 📌 Implementation Notes

- LLM adapters in `lib/llm/*` should be updated with specific provider clients (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- The section-based generation pattern is demonstrated in `convex/actions/generatePhase.ts`.
- Admin pages for managing models and limits are available under `/admin`.
